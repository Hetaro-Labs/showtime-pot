# Proof of Togetherness (PoT) 

This is a proof of concept for Proof of Togetherness, implemented as an Solana program.

## The concept 

Use the Social Graph to validate users' credibility through attendance and interaction data.

## How it works?

We use the PoT Protocol to connect the users' PoT devices (phones, watches, rings...) and applications (POAP, micropayments, loans...)

## Example use case

1. User A host an event (e.g. a show up challenge) at PoT Protocol

2. Every event guest (User A, B, C, D ) stake 10k Bonk to the challenge

3. During the event, only User A, B, C show up and proof it by their watch

4. After the event, the 3 people who shown up can share the 40k Bonk. Everyone can claim about 13.3k Bonk!
